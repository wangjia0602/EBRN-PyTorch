# EBRN-PyTorch
Embedded Block Residual Network: A Recursive Restoration Model for Single-Image Super-Resolution

I found that there seems to be no PyTorch version of EBRN, so I took a few hours to reproduce and verify it. There are still shortcomings in the code structure optimization, please forgive me. Please contact me if there is any error.
